token :- tokens are smallest programing element/unit .
panchuaters :- like semi colon ( ; ).
literals :- like numric value 20
literals are the values use during thr execution of programes.
keyword :- its a reserve words, which have special meaning for the compiler.
keywords are always return in lower case.
ex :- include,int 

identifier :- its a name given to diffrent programing element like variables , methods/functions , classes, structures, union, namespace. we will try to give meaningfull names to programing elements, by reading the names we will be able to identify the pourpos of that particular element.

*we have to follow the naming conventions.
variables name are return in snake_case.

*snake_case :- words are seprated by underscore (_).
example :- total_bill_amount, hello_world.cpp .

* cpp program files name are also return in snake_case conventions.

next day :-

literals :-
types of literals:-
numeric literals :- 10 .
boolean :- true / false
float :- 1.01 .
character :- ex:- 'a' .
string literal :- ex:- "hello_world".

operators :- this are the operators like addtion, multiplication, insertion, etraction, scoopresolution, etc. are the operators that are going to operat on your code.

example :- 10 + 20, 5 * 3.

punctuators :- #include <iostream> ------ > pre prosesor directive
	         using namespace std ;  

	         int main( ){

					           

}
all the tokens are seprated by a whitespace or tab or new line.

comment :- 1 :-  // its a single line comment 
	   2 :- /* multi line comment 
		second line ________
		third line _______
		so on _______
	          */

 guideline :- after 80 characters in single line it well change .

Next day :-

write a program to print your name and rell number and address on the output screen / consol .
in below mention format 
vaibhav diwan, 81, kolar road

Next day :-

data type and variables :-

variables :- it will hold values.variables are programing elements whose values will change during the execution of programs.

primitive type/pre defined  2. derived type 3. user defined 

int --> integar value (real numbers) ex- 0,1,2,3,-1,-2,-3, etc.
float --> floating point numbers ( fractional number ) ex- 4.75 , 2.65, -2.4, etc.
double --> double prisision ex- 3.14, 8.65, etc.
char --> characters ex- a, c, d, e, r, A, S, F, R,W, etc.
string --> 
bool --> boolean ex- true, false.
		  1    ,   0

sapce ocupide by the data type it is depend on the  artichecture of the system and the software.

bytes	4	8	1	1	
	int	float	char	bool

Declariation of variables :-
syntax:-
datatype, variable_name / identifier ;


int roll_number ; 


*do not do this :-
	1. if you want to declair multiple variable of type int.
		int number1,number2,number3;

	2. you can print all the variable by single cout,with multiple insertion operator
		cout << number << "," <<  number2 << "," << number3 << "\n" ;

*operators :- four types of operator
	1.Arthmatic operator :- to perform mathamatical operations. - ,+ ,* , %, /, &, =.
		% (modulo) --> modulo division to get remainder of divison.
		= (Assignmnent operator) --> to assign the value in the variable.

	2.
	3.



truth table :-

or operator (||) :-

	exp1	exp2	result
	 F	 T 	  F
	 T	 F	  T
	 F	 T	  T
	 T	 T	  T

NOT OPERATOR ( ! ):-

	exp1	!	result
	  T	!T	  F
	  F	!F	  T

AND OPERATOR ( && ) :- 
	
	exp1	exp2	






Conditional  Statement :-

--> 


diffrence btw switch and nested if

1.nested if condition  is a step by step prossesor while switch case is a choise based programing .
2.nested if condition is slower then switch case statement.
3.if condition supports all types of operators while switch case only support arthmatich operator.

note: switch case does't support float values.

while loop will execute the statement or code if and only if the condition is ture, otherwise it will come out from the loop it is also called entry loop.

for loop: for loop will execute the statemnet or code till the condition is true, otherwise it will terminet the loop for loop is use for certainity of loop.

syntax:-
			for (variable initialize; condition ; increment/decrement){
				statement/code;
			}
